# Strings: Word Counter in a String (Using Function in C)

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a C program that counts the total number of words in a given string using a function.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. **Declare** a character array `a` of size 100, and variables `i` and `count`, initialized to `0` and `1` respectively.
2. **Read** a string (including spaces) until a newline character is encountered and store it in array `a`.
3. **Use** a `do-while` loop to iterate through each character of the string:
   - **Increment** `count` every time a space `' '`, newline `'\n'`, or tab `'\t'` character is encountered.
4. **Print** the final value of `count`, which represents the total number of words in the string.
